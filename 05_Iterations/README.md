# JavaScript Looping Examples

This folder contains basic examples of different looping techniques in JavaScript.

## ğŸ“š What's Inside

### 1. **For Loop**
- A simple `for` loop that counts from 1 to 10.
- Includes a condition to detect when the value is 5.

### 2. **Nested For Loops**
- Used to generate a multiplication table (1 to 10).
- Demonstrates inner and outer loop interactions.

### 3. **Array Iteration**
- Looping through a sample array of Hinglish words.
- Prints each word and the total length of the array.

### 4. **Break and Continue**
- `continue`: Skips iteration when number 5 is detected.
- `break`: Stops the loop completely when number 5 is detected.

### 5. **While Loop**
- Counts from 0 to 10 by increments of 2.
- Also demonstrates iterating through an array of superheroes using a `while` loop.

### 6. **For Loop vs While Loop**
- Side-by-side comparison by iterating through the same superhero array using a `for` loop.

### 7. **Do-While Loop**
- Demonstrates that code runs **at least once**, even if the condition is false.
- Includes a special case where the loop runs once even though the condition is initially false.

## ğŸ’¡ Key Takeaways

- Use `for` loops when you know how many times to iterate.
- Use `while` when the number of iterations is unknown.
- `do-while` ensures at least one execution.
- `break` and `continue` help control loop behavior effectively.
- Always keep your loop boundaries and conditions clear to avoid infinite loops.

## ğŸ§  Tip for Revision
Remember the line:
> "do while -> kaam pehle hoga, fir condition check hogi"  
Just like saying:
> "Pehle kaam kar, fir paisa milega!" ğŸ˜‰
